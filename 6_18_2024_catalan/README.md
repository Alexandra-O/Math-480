# Catalan Objects
In this assignment, you will learn to generate data for [Catalan objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number). The Catalan numbers are a famous sequence of numbers in combinatorics and have lots of different but equivalent interpretations. In fact, there is a whole book on them titled "[Catalan Numbers](https://www.amazon.com/Catalan-Numbers-Richard-P-Stanley/dp/1107427746)" by a well known combinatorist - Richard P. Stanley.

The 4 types of Catalan objects you will generate data for are:
* Matching parenthesizations
* Associative orders on products
* 231-avoiding permutations
* Triangulations of a polygon

Furthermore, for each object you generate, you will also record the time it takes to generate the objects and plot a graph to see how the time required varies with $n$. In theory, all Catalan objects can be generated equally quickly, but you may find that the simplest approach for some objects is less efficient than others!

If you are interested in learning more, there are beautiful connections between the Catalan numbers and a polytope called the [associahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associahedron). Furthermore, you can impose additional structure on certain Catalan objects to obtain something called the [Tamari lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamari_lattice).
